## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Highlights

### Implemented Patterns
1. **Multi-tenancy**: Organization-based data isolation
2. **Double-entry bookkeeping**: Comprehensive financial tracking
3. **Provider abstraction**: Pluggable payment providers
4. **Event-driven architecture**: WebSocket + Celery tasks
5. **Comprehensive audit logging**: All user actions tracked

### Key Technical Decisions
1. **UPI-first payments**: Own provider integration vs third-party
2. **Platform-managed settlements**: Escrow-like fund handling
3. **JSON-based flows**: No-code vertical customization
4. **OSRM for routing**: Self-hosted vs API services
5. **Flutter for mobile**: Single codebase for both platforms
